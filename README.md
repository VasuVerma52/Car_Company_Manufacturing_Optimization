Problem Statement:-

Suppose you own a car company, which produces two models of a car, Model 1 and Model 2. Their selling prices are ₹30 lakh and ₹45 lakh, respectively. You purchase the components of both the cars from another manufacturer at ₹15 lakh and ₹22.5 lakh, respectively and then assemble them. One of the primary reasons for your success is that you test the cars thoroughly after assembling them and before rolling them out in the market. Assembling costs you ₹1,100 per labour hour; Model 1 requires 500 assembling hours, and Model 2, 600 assembling hours. Testing is a slightly more expensive process, at ₹1,500 per labour hour; you need 100 hours for testing Model 1 and 200 hours for testing Model 2. With the number of workers in your factory, the maximum number of assembly hours and testing hours that you can get is also limited, that is, 10,00,000 assembly hours and 3,00,000 testing hours.


You recently manufactured a new premium model, Model3, which you have decided to sell at ₹60 lakh. Its components cost ₹27.5 lakh, and it requires 800 assembly hours and 300 testing hours.


You ask your marketing team to provide you the sales prediction along with the respective costs of all three models. They tell you they can sell a maximum of 600 cars of Model 1, 1200 cars of Model 2, and only 50 cars of Model 3, as it is new and expensive. At this point, you realise that you don't have enough working labour hours to maximise the production to 600 + 1200 + 50 cars, i.e., 1850 cars. You decide to hire more workers, but until then, you have to manage with the current restraints. Now, with these restraints in place, you have to determine how many of each model you should produce to maximise your profits.

 

After determining the optimum distribution, you have to do a sensitivity analysis to see the effect of a change in the selling price of Model 3 on the overall distribution and profits.
