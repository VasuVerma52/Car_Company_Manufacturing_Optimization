Problem Statement:-

Suppose that you're working for some company XYZ and they're looking to launch a new product. For this, the company has prepared a small 10-second ad to be showcased on television. Now, your company wants to do an ad campaign for this product on television on three main types of channels - News, Sports, and Entertainment. The cost of ad time is different for each of these channels and this cost also varies owing to the day of the week, i.e., the cost on the weekends is 20% more than that during the weekdays. The cost/10 seconds of ad time (on weekdays) on these three types of channels are:

    News: ₹40,000
    Sports: ₹80,000
    Entertainment: ₹65,000

The marketing budget allotted for this ad campaign is ₹10 crore and the plan to distribute it is as follows:

    At least ₹2 crores spent on each of the three types of channel.
    At least ₹2.5 crores spent during the weekdays.
    At least ₹4 crores spent during the weekends.
    At least ₹50 lakhs spent/type of channel/type of day i.e., at least ₹50 lakhs should be spent on every type of channel and on every type of the day, i.e., both weekdays and weekends. For example, money spent on ad time, say, news channels on weekdays should be at least ₹50 lakhs. Similarly, money spent on entertainment channels on weekends should be at least ₹50 lakhs.

So using the budget allocated and all the above constraints, you want to maximise the number of times the ad is shown on TV.
